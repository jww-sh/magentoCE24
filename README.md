## Composer Authentication and Post Installation Setup

1. Get your Magento Repository authentication keys https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/install-gde/prereq/connect-auth.html
2. Add your keys as a project level variable `platform variable:create -p <your Platform.sh projectID> --level project --name env:COMPOSER_AUTH --json true --visible-runtime false --sensitive true --visible-build true  --value '{"http-basic":{"repo.magento.com":{"username":"<your public key>","password":"<your private key>"}}}'`    
3. Please add an admin user using `php bin/magento admin:user:create`.  Login at `/admin` in your browser. 
4. If you need to disable Magento two factor auth for admin logins on development enviroments with mail disabled, please SSH into your application and run `bin/magento config:set twofactorauth/general/enable 0` 

## Customizations

The following changes have been made relative to Magento 2 as it is downloaded from Magento.com.  If using this project as a reference for your own existing project, replicate the changes below to your project.

* The `.platform.app.yaml`, `.platform/services.yaml`, and `.platform/routes.yaml` files have been added.  These provide Platform.sh-specific configuration and are present in all projects on Platform.sh.  You may customize them as you see fit.
* The `.upsun/config.yaml` files has been added. This provides Upsun-specific configuration which can also be reviewed.
* The `composer.json` file has had the ECE-Tools package and its dependencies added.
* Magento crons have been setup to ensure they are run sequentially to ensure there is availible memory
* A logrotate and report housekeeping cron have been added.
* A module which allows two factor authentication to be disabled has been added to `composer.json`.
